## Prerequisites

This extension requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to be installed and
available on your PATH. The extension uses `uvx` to run the bundled
`marimo-lsp` language server.

Install uv:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

- ‚ú® Rich output rendering with interactive UI elements
- üì¶ Integrated package and environment management
- üîç Variables explorer and datasources panel

## Getting Started

1. Ensure [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is installed
2. Install this extension from the VS Code Marketplace
3. Open a marimo notebook (`.py` file), or create a new one:
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
   - Run **"Create: Marimo notebook"**
4. VS Code will prompt you to open the file as a marimo notebook
