# Start Your marimo Journey

marimo is a reactive notebook for Python — run reproducible experiments, query with SQL, execute as a script, deploy as an app, and version with git.

## What Makes marimo Special?

- **Reactive**: Run a cell or interact with a UI element, and marimo automatically runs dependent cells (or marks them as stale), keeping code and outputs consistent.
- **Pure Python**: marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python files, executable as scripts, and deployable as apps.
- **Reproducible**: No hidden state, no out-of-order execution problems.
